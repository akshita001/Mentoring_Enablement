The advantages of ML are useful where large dataset is available. Large scale deployments of ML is beneficial in terms of improved velocity and accuracy. It helps in understanding non-linearity of the data and generates a function mapping input to ouput from supervised learning standpoint. Lot of aspects around supervised, unsupervised and reinforced learning can be performed. This by and large ensures better profiling of customers to understand their needs. It helps serve customers better and reduce customer attrition.

## Data Visualization
Below are some of URLs that can be referred for learning (but not exhaustive list by any means)

### Predict Web Page Tags based on its content
Classification of Web page content is vital to many tasks in Web information retrieval such as maintaining Web
directories and focused crawling. The uncontrolled nature of Web content presents additional challenges to Web page
classification as compared to traditional text classification, however the interconnected nature of hypertext
also provides features that can assist the process.

Here the task is to classify the web pages to the respective classes it belongs to, in a single label classification
setup (Each webpage can belong to only 1 class).

Basically given the complete html and url, predict the tag a web page belongs to out of 9 predefined tags as given below:

* People profile
* Conferences/Congress
* Forums
* News article
* Clinical trials
* Publication
* Thesis
* Guidelines
* Others

## Computer Vision
Computer Vision is a sub branch of AI whose objective is to provide computers the powerful ability to understand their sorrounding by seeing the things more than hearing or feeling, just like humans. Kind of mimicing human ability to interpret by learning certain aspects.
Some applications of Computer Vision are as follows:

- Controlling processes
- Navigation
- Organizing set of information
- Automatic inspection
- Modeling objects or environments
- Detecting events
- Recognize objects
- Recognize actions
- Track objects in action

### Apache Superset - for Data exploration and visualization

Apache Superset (incubating) is a modern, enterprise-ready business intelligence web application
