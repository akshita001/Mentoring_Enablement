# Data Science and AI Mentoring - my 8 steps
_(Step -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and Infinity)_

### Objective
is to provide some thoughts, pointers around Data Science and AI for my mentees to get a direction. I get an opportunity to learn from them, my team and everyone that I interact and collaborate across around this theme.

### My Suggestion
Data Science is a journey and there are no short cuts around it like everything else where we want get into success. Let me also be very clear and request some of these key points to my mentees and whoever is reading this content. The content we need depends on the objectives that we would intend to pursue in life. The foundations and interpretations may vary depending on what we want to accomplish in a specific span - a Data Science Practitioner, Applied Data Scientist, Research Scientist and so on. Every role would expect us to get into different flavours of understanding and focus.

I would like to create an outline as an initial draft approach.

## (Step: -2): Pre-Requisites: Mindset 

* Mindset of Mathematics + Computer Science + Statistics + Programming + Story telling
* Mindset of Data Science Method/Approach to Success

Focus on a business problem and trying to understand business KPIs, drivers that are required as part of goal formulation and define strategy accordingly alligning to CRISP-DM methodology from an end to end Data Science perspective. Below diagram depicts a high level outline of the approach.

## (Step:  0) DS/AI Ecosystem, Methodologies

* [Fundamentals of CRISP-DM Methodologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-industry_standard_process_for_data_mining)

One must understand key aspects on CRISP-DM methodlogy, applications / use cases of Machine Learning. This repository focuses on some tutorials using open datasets.

![plot of chunk crisp-dm](/figures/crisp-dm.png)

CRISP-DM stands for Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining. It talks about various process phases / steps / lifecycle stages in a typical data science program.

- _Business Understanding_
- _Data Understanding_
- _Data Preparation_
- _Model Development_
- _Model Evaluation_
- _Deployment_

* Understanding where to spend 80% of effort in an end to end DS journey and where to spend 20% - 80-20 aspect that I call


## (Step:  1) Machine Learning Fundamentals

fast.ai from Jeremy Howard and R. Thomas

* Watch DeepLearning.ai course lectures I, II, IV and V
* Go through fast.ai Part 1
* Watch DeepLearning.ai course lecture III
* Go through DeepLearning.ai assignments
* Repeat steps above

## (Step:  3) Delve into some depth around ML and DL

* Go through use cases and solve a use case 
* Use Kaggle
* Understand a framework and try to use it - PyTorch, Keras, Tensorflow
* [Write effective technical blogs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YODPgBadj80)

## (Step:  4) Deep dive into ML and DL

## (Step: Infinity) Continuous Learning, Stay Current
This is all about continuous learning - what I refer as CD learning - Continuous Deep Learning. Sky is the limit. Keep yourself up to date and continue to learn. There is no end to it.

The advantages of ML are useful where large dataset is available. Large scale deployments of ML is beneficial in terms of improved velocity and accuracy. It helps in understanding non-linearity of the data and generates a function mapping input to ouput from supervised learning standpoint. Lot of aspects around supervised, unsupervised and reinforced learning can be performed. This by and large ensures better profiling of customers to understand their needs. It helps serve customers better and reduce customer attrition.

## Computer Vision
Computer Vision is a sub branch of AI whose objective is to provide computers the powerful ability to understand their sorrounding by seeing the things more than hearing or feeling, just like humans. Kind of mimicing human ability to interpret by learning certain aspects.
Some applications of Computer Vision are as follows:

- Controlling processes
- Navigation
- Organizing set of information
- Automatic inspection
- Modeling objects or environments
- Detecting events
- Recognize objects
- Recognize actions
- Track objects in action

## Experiments

### Part 1: R Programming with univariate and bivariate analysis
These are program components which are used for mentoring purposes

### Part 2: Time series Forecasting in R
These are program components which are used for mentoring purposes

### Predict Web Page Tags based on its content
Classification of Web page content is vital to many tasks in Web information retrieval such as maintaining Web
directories and focused crawling. The uncontrolled nature of Web content presents additional challenges to Web page
classification as compared to traditional text classification, however the interconnected nature of hypertext
also provides features that can assist the process.

Here the task is to classify the web pages to the respective classes it belongs to, in a single label classification
setup (Each webpage can belong to only 1 class).

Basically given the complete html and url, predict the tag a web page belongs to out of 9 predefined tags as given below:

* People profile
* Conferences/Congress
* Forums
* News article
* Clinical trials
* Publication
* Thesis
* Guidelines
* Others
