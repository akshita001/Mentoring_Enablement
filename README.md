The advantages of ML are useful where large dataset is available. Large scale deployments of ML is beneficial in terms of improved velocity and accuracy. It helps in understanding non-linearity of the data and generates a function mapping input to ouput from supervised learning standpoint. Lot of aspects around supervised, unsupervised and reinforced learning can be performed. This by and large ensures better profiling of customers to understand their needs. It helps serve customers better and reduce customer attrition.

### Predict Web Page Tags based on its content
Classification of Web page content is vital to many tasks in Web information retrieval such as maintaining Web
directories and focused crawling. The uncontrolled nature of Web content presents additional challenges to Web page
classification as compared to traditional text classification, however the interconnected nature of hypertext
also provides features that can assist the process.

Here the task is to classify the web pages to the respective classes it belongs to, in a single label classification
setup (Each webpage can belong to only 1 class).

Basically given the complete html and url, predict the tag a web page belongs to out of 9 predefined tags as given below:

* People profile
* Conferences/Congress
* Forums
* News article
* Clinical trials
* Publication
* Thesis
* Guidelines
* Others
